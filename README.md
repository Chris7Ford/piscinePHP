# Piscine PHP

### Purpose
The purpose of the piscine PHP is to acquaint the student with the basics of web technologies.  The choice of the language is flexible, but my choice was PHP being that this two-week intensive course was made specifically for PHP.  The point for me was to strengthen web development concepts, which I felt could be done in any language.

#### Breakdown
This course is very similar to [Piscine C](https://github.com/Chris7Ford/Piscine-C) in that there is an assigment that begins each morning with group projects on the weekends.  The difference is that the corrections don't need to be done immediately, and the course is only two weeks long rather than 4.

The difficult part of the piscine, as usual, was the rigor.  If you fail one of the first exercises, you fail the whole day!  The later exercises are weighted much more heavily as well.
